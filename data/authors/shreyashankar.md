Shreya Shankar is doing her PhD in databases at UC Berkeley, advised by Dr. Aditya Parameswaran. She is broadly interested in data management for machine learning (ML), with an emphasis on helping non-ML experts build and productionize ML pipelines. She is currently working on a new framework for building ML pipelines with automatic data validation, model retraining, and observability. Outside of research, she enjoys making ice creams, hiking, and sampling Bay Area coffee roasters.
